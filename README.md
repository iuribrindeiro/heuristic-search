# heuristic-search made with elm

This project demonstrates the use of the [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science)) to find the shortest path between two points on a grid.

The example used here is an 8 puzzle game, where the goal is to move the tiles to the correct position.

The heuristic used is the [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry), which is the sum of the distances of the tiles to their correct positions.

> f = g + h

where:
* g = the distance from the starting point to the current point
* h = the number of tiles that are not in their correct position
